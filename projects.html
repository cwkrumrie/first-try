      <h3><a href="quiz.html">Project #1 - Practice Quiz for Students</a></h3>
      This was my first project I coded completely on my own. Students (first-year 
      writing students) in a previous term suggested that I provide
      future students with opportunities to practice for upcoming quizzes.
      To that end, I set out to create an interactive quiz app as a study tool.

      <h3><a href="class.html">Project #2 - Classroom Website</a></h3>
      For this project, I was approached by a colleague who was teaching a
      literature course using Canvas for the first time. They requested a homepage
      with accessible links to other Canvas pages, course information,
      and links to appropriate external resources. During an initial meeting,
      they also indicated they wanted specific colors and that they wanted
      a simple, minimalist design.
