      I began my coding experience back in the mid-2000s where I customized my
      first bits of HTML on MySpace. Over time, I've developed a passion for
      planning, designing, and evaluating digital experiences that are
      accessible, attractive, and usable. 
      <br /><br />
      While my educational background lies in the humanities (I did both my
      undergraduate and graduate studies in English literature), my experience
      working in learner-focused positions for more than a decade has allowed me
      the freedom to explore my interest in web development. As an educator, I
      have built custom classroom websites and interactive learning experiences.
      <br /><br />
      When I'm not working, I'm usually either reading, playing video games, or
      relaxing with my husband and our dogs.
